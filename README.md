Source code and solutions for exercises in my book, [Design Patterns for Vue.js: A Test Driven Approach to Maintainable Applications](https://lachlan-miller.me/design-patterns-for-vuejs).

If you want to run the tests locally, you can install the dependencies with `npm install` and run them with `"npm run cypress:run"` for Cypress or `"npm run vitest"` for Vitest.

Some of the section have a UI associated with them, you can import the relevant example into `examples/.index.ts` and start the dev server with `npx vite dev`.
